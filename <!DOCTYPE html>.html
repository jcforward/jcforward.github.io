        <h1>James Forward</h1>
        <p>I am a Research Assistant of <a href="https://ctb.ucsf.edu/">Cell and Tissue Biology</a> at The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). I currently conduct research in <a href="https://www.fredchanglab.ucsf.edu/">Dr. Fred Chang's Laboratory</a>, where I am looking at the intersection of quantitative cell biology, biophysics and microbial genetics. Here is a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dfuq3eup0v7tz3pih2anm/James_Forward_CV_2024.pdf?rlkey=gpchynx92gsfjf2u73j8mjgz1&st=hzsqh434&dl=0">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>
        <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/">The University of British Columbia (UBC)</a> in Vancouver, Canada. I was previously an Undergraduate Researcher in <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/kinglab/">in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology</a>, where I investigated how temperature affects bacterial morphogenesis and growth and developed (attempted to develop) tools to engineer undomesticated bacteria. I also served as the President of the <a href="https://ubcneuroscienceclub.wixsite.com/uncweb">UBC Neuroscience Association</a> and was a member of the UBC Department of Neuroscienceâ€™s steering committee.</p>
